## Unit Testing

From [official documentation](https://piolabs.com/blog/insights/unit-testing-part-1.html)

Running local unit tests (native unit tests) is not feasible because the library is too tightly integrated with Arduino and FreeRTOS.
We need to setup a remote device to make the pipeline run on it.
